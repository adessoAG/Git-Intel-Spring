# GitStalker-Spring

Currently under development..

The GitStalker will be used to crawl information from Github and process the data to access more detailed informationen about everything on Github. 
The Stalker uses the current GraphQL API of Github. 

The suitable Front-End is the [GitStalkerBootstrapUI](https://github.com/adessoAG/GitStalkerBootstrapUI).

# Quickstart
The application requires a MongoDB to start. Here you can check how the installation works: [MondoDB Installation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

After successful installation and execution of the MongoDB, the back-end can be started using the Gradle command 'bootRun'. It is now ready to receive and process requests from the front end.
